This project aims to answer the question:
  Is the economy as bad as the news wants us to believe?
  Has the economy change that drastically from the situation our parents were in when they were our age?

  A means to answer this question is to quantify the average household income, changes in tax brackets, the cost of housing, the cost of automobiles, and the cost of having a child.
